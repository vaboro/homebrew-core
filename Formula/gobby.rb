  # Necessary to remove mandatory gtk-mac-integration
  # it's badly broken as it depends on an ancient version of ige-mac-integration
  # since it depends on gtk3, it doesn't even need gtk-mac-integration anymore
  # This has already been fixed upstream: gtk2 support has been dropped completely
  # and all traces of ige-mac-integration have been removed from the code
